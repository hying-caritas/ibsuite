Convert HTML to PDF with mozilla rendering engine.

The best rendering application of HTML is web browser such as
FireFox(Mozilla), but full function web browser is too large for some
devices such as ebook reader. One of the solution is to pre-render
HTML on PC with web browser and send the resulting PDF to devices.


* Usage and configuration

Make sure you have Xulrunner correctly installed.

xulrunner --app ibhtml2pdf/application.ini [-pw <width>] [-ph <height>] \
	  file:///tmp/foo.html /tmp/foo.pdf

-pw and -ph is to used to specify paper width and height.

|I don't know if it works under windows.|

* Note: Running on Windows

In order to get ibhtml2pdf to work on windows you'll need to install
a suitable postscript printer. Download the "winsteng.exe" from Adobe
http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/product.jsp?product=44&platform=Windows
install and configure a printer called "Generic PostScript Printer" that prints
to a FILE: port.

At this point ibhtml2pdf should work normally on windows as well with no changes.
