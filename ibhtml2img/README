Convert HTML to image with mozilla rendering engine.

The best rendering application of HTML is web browser such as
FireFox(Mozilla), but full function web browser is too large for some
devices such as ebook reader. One of the solution is to pre-render
HTML on PC with web browser and send the resulting image to
devices.
