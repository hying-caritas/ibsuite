convert ebook in various format (pdf, chm, html) into a set of images,
reformat the images (crop, embold, divide, etc), and assemble the
result images into a new ebook.

ibtools:
	A set of utilities and tools, some of them are used internal

USAGE
-----

The most important command of ibsuite is ibreformat, the basic usage
is as follow:

  ibreformat [options] <input file>

In most cases, something like following:

  ibreformat -o <output file> --iprof=<iprof> --oprof=<oprof> \
    --pprof=<pprof> <input file>

Where <input file> is input file name, <output file> is output file
name, <iprof> is input profile, <oprof> is output profile, <pprof> is
processing profile.

Available input/output/processing profiles are as follow:

input profiles:

img: for scanned book

output profiles:

prs505p: for Sony PRS505 in portrait mode

prs505l: for Sony PRS505 in landscape mode

processing profiles:

divide2: divide one line into two line (a kind of simple reflow)

resize: Resize and dilate pages

repage: Re-page input book, without much other processing such as dilate.


For other command line options, please refer to "ibreformat -h".


Some useful command line option combinations:

For scanned book on PRS505:

  ibsuite -o <output file> -iprof=img -pprof=resize -oprof=prs505l <input file>

For chm file on PRS505:

  ibchm2imb <xxx>.chm

When it finishs, <xxx>.imb will be generated, then

  ibsuite -o <output file> -pprof=repage --oprof=prs505l <xxx>.imb
